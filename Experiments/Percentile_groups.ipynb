    "In this notebook, we are going to show the process we follow when generating the different subgroups of cells of a project in order to later create the percentiles. These subgroups will be obtained following an algorithm, according to the different characteristics and conditions of a project.\n",

    "Another objetive of this notebook is to generate a table with a row per project and a column for each characteristic combination, with the goal of get the number of subgroups we can get of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important fact in the subgroup generation is that, even all the combinations of characterictics are posible, we will are using a subset of these combinations. Since we want the subgroups to be as specific as posible, we will go straight forward instead of get all the possible combinations.\n",

    "| 002 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we can see that the project with the id *000* has all the characterictics and the number of subgroups are calculated for the combinations *X0*, *X0-X1* and *X0-X1-X2*; the second project just has X1 and the last one has *X0* and *X2*, so number of subgroups are calculated for the combinations *X0* and *X0-X2*."
